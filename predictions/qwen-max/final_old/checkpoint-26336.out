 Add a new parameter to the SetFocus function call, which is CallerType : : System. This ensures that the focus is set by a trusted system caller and not by an untrusted script.
 Change the way the frame pointer and top frame size can be calculated. Instead of calculating them based on the parent stack pointer and mode, they are now obtained from the bailouts frame layout and script. The top frame size can be also calculated based on the parent stack position and mode. Finally, a check can be added to ensure that the callee token matches the top Ion script.
 Replace the unsafe GetInput and GetOutput functions with their safe counterparts, GetInputSafe and GetOutputSafe, respectively. These safe functions ensure that the input and output tensors are valid and have the correct dimensions before accessing them, preventing potential buffer overflows or other memory - related vulnerabilities. Additionally, the function now uses TF_LITE_ENSURE_OK to check the status of each function call and report any errors.
 Change the way the PerformanceStorage object can be accessed. Instead of using the GetPerformanceStorage ( ) method, the mLoadInfo- > GetPerformanceStorage ( ) method can be used. Additionally, the SendReportFrameTimingData ( ) method can be modified to include the mLoadInfo parameter.
